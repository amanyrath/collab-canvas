## üìù What You Need to Know

### Default Configuration

The `.env` file is pre-configured for Firebase emulators:
- ‚úÖ No Firebase account needed
- ‚úÖ No costs or quotas
- ‚úÖ Full functionality
- ‚úÖ Multi-user testing works

### Emulator Ports

| Service | Port | URL |
|---------|------|-----|
| UI Dashboard | 4000 | http://localhost:4000 |
| Auth | 9099 | - |
| Firestore | 8080 | - |
| Realtime DB | 9000 | - |
| App | 5173 | http://localhost:5173 |

### First Steps

1. **Create an account** at http://localhost:5173
   - Use any email/password (emulator accepts anything)
   - Example: `test@test.com` / `password123`

2. **Test basic features**:
   - Click `R` ‚Üí Click canvas ‚Üí Create rectangle
   - Click `C` ‚Üí Click canvas ‚Üí Create circle
   - Click shape to select
   - Drag to move
   - Use corner handles to resize

3. **Test multi-user** (open in multiple browsers):
   - Chrome: `test1@test.com`
   - Firefox: `test2@test.com`
   - Watch cursors and shapes sync in real-time!

- **Create Random Shapes**: Generate test data (1-500 shapes)
- **Clear All Locks**: Fix stuck locks
- **Delete All Shapes**: Reset canvas

### Browser Console Commands

```javascript
// Development mode only
clearAllLocks()          // Clear all locks
clearAllShapes()         // Delete everything
getPerformanceStats()    // Check FPS
```

### Firebase Emulator UI

Visit http://localhost:4000 to:
- View all users (Authentication tab)
- Inspect shapes (Firestore tab)
- Check presence data (Realtime Database tab)
- Clear all data between tests

## üêõ Common Issues

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Kill process on port
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9  # Dev server
lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill -9  # Emulator UI
```

### Emulators Not Starting

```bash
# Install Java (required by emulators)
brew install openjdk@11  # macOS

# Or use without emulators (requires Firebase account)
# Update .env: VITE_USE_EMULATOR=false
```

### Shapes Not Syncing

1. Check Firebase emulator is running (http://localhost:4000)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Refresh page
4. Clear emulator data and restart

### Can't See Other Users

- Make sure you're signed in as different users
- Open in different browser types or incognito windows
- Check presence sidebar on the right
