## Development Setup

### Local Development with Firebase Emulators

For local development without Firebase costs:

1. **Configure .env for emulators:**
   ```env
   VITE_USE_EMULATOR=true
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=demo-project
   # ... other demo values
   ```

2. **Start emulators:**
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

3. **In another terminal, start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Testing AI Features

If working on AI agent features:

1. **Get API keys:**
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Tavily: https://tavily.com/

2. **Add to .env:**
   ```env
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   VITE_TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...
   ```

3. **Test setup:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-agent-setup.js
   ```

### Key Files to Know

| File | Purpose | Complexity |
|------|---------|------------|
| `components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx` | Main canvas component, tools, keyboard | Medium |
| `components/Canvas/ShapeLayer.tsx` | Shape rendering, selection, drag/resize | **High** |
| `store/canvasStore.ts` | Canvas state management | Medium |
| `utils/shapeUtils.ts` | Shape CRUD operations | Low |
| `utils/lockUtils.ts` | Lock management with transactions | Medium |
| `agent/executor.ts` | AI command execution | High |

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Choose What to Work On

- Check [open issues](https://github.com/amanyrath/collabcanvas-fresh/issues)
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your fork
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Lint your code
npm run lint

# Build to check for errors
npm run build

# Test manually in the browser
npm run dev
```

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Code builds without errors
- [ ] No ESLint warnings
- [ ] Feature works as expected
- [ ] Doesn't break existing features
- [ ] Works in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Works with multiple users (open in multiple browser windows)

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add shape rotation feature"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring

- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add undo/redo functionality"
git commit -m "fix: resolve cursor sync issue when user disconnects"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new keyboard shortcuts"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify lock cleanup logic"
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define interfaces for data structures
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use type inference where appropriate

```typescript
// Good
interface Shape {
  id: string;
  type: 'rectangle' | 'circle' | 'triangle';
  x: number;
  y: number;
  fill: string;
}

// Bad
const shape: any = { ... };
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Use meaningful prop names

```typescript
// Good
interface ShapeProps {
  shape: Shape;
  isSelected: boolean;
  onSelect: (id: string) => void;
}

export function ShapeComponent({ shape, isSelected, onSelect }: ShapeProps) {
  // Component logic
}

// Bad - unclear prop names
export function Shape({ s, sel, fn }) {
  // Component logic
}
```

### State Management

- Use Zustand stores for global state
- Use local state (useState) for component-specific state
- Keep state updates immutable
- Document complex state transitions

```typescript
// Good - immutable update
const addShape = (shape: Shape) => {
  set((state) => ({
    shapes: [...state.shapes, shape]
  }));
};

// Bad - mutating state
const addShape = (shape: Shape) => {
  state.shapes.push(shape); // Don't do this!
};
```

### File Organization

- One component per file
- Co-locate related files
- Use index files to simplify imports
- Keep files under 500 lines when possible

### Comments

- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Explain "why" not "what"
- Document edge cases

```typescript
// Good - explains why
// Use Firestore transaction to prevent race conditions when multiple
// users try to lock the same shape simultaneously
await runTransaction(db, async (transaction) => {
  // ...
});

// Bad - states the obvious
// This function adds two numbers
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b; // Returns the sum
}
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (`ShapeLayer.tsx`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (`createShape()`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_SHAPES`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (`Shape`, `UserPresence`)
- **Files**: kebab-case for utils (`shape-utils.ts`)

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

Since we don't have automated tests yet, thorough manual testing is crucial:

1. **Single User Testing**
   - Test all basic features
   - Try edge cases
   - Check error handling

2. **Multi-User Testing**
   - Open app in 2-3 browser windows
   - Test collaboration features
   - Verify real-time sync
   - Test lock conflicts

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Create many shapes (100+)
   - Check FPS with Performance Display
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Test with slow network (Chrome DevTools â†’ Network)

4. **Browser Testing**
   - Chrome (primary)
   - Firefox
   - Safari
   - Edge

### AI Agent Testing

For AI-related changes, test with:

```bash
# Run test commands
node scripts/test-command-types.js
```

Test various command types:
- Creation commands
- Manipulation commands
- Layout commands
- Complex commands
