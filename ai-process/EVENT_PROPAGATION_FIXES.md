# Event Propagation Fixes - Comprehensive Analysis

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 🐛 **Issue #1: Multi-Select Not Working**
**Root Cause**: Event propagation conflict between Shape onClick and Stage onClick handlers.

**Problem Flow**:
1. User clicks shape with Shift key (attempting multi-select)
2. Shape's `onClick` handler fires → adds shape to selection ✅
3. Event bubbles up to Stage's `onClick` handler → creates new shape or deselects all ❌
4. Result: Multi-select fails

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `e.cancelBubble = true` and `e.evt.stopPropagation()` to shape click handler
- Prevents event from reaching Stage handler
- Location: `ShapeLayer.tsx` → `handleClick` function

### 🐛 **Issue #2: Shape Creation Interference**
**Root Cause**: Background rectangle in ShapeLayer wasn't passing click events properly to Stage.

**Problem Flow**:
1. User clicks empty canvas
2. Click hits background-rect in Layer
3. Stage onClick only accepts `targetType === 'Stage'`
4. Click is ignored → no shape created

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated Canvas.tsx Stage click handler to accept both `Stage` AND `background-rect` clicks
- Added proper target name checking
- Location: `Canvas.tsx` → `handleStageClick` function

### 🐛 **Issue #3: Drag-to-Select Interference**
**Root Cause**: Shift+MouseDown events could bubble to Stage and cause shape creation.

**Problem Flow**:
1. User presses Shift+MouseDown on background (starting marquee selection)
2. ShapeLayer's `handleLayerMouseDown` starts selection ✅
3. Event could bubble to Stage → might interfere with other handlers ❌

**Fix Applied**:
- Added event.stopPropagation() to `handleLayerMouseDown`
- Prevents interference with Stage handlers
- Location: `ShapeLayer.tsx` → `handleLayerMouseDown` function

### 🐛 **Issue #4: Drag and Transform Events**
**Root Cause**: Shape drag and transform events could bubble and cause unintended behavior.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added event.stopPropagation() to:
  - `handleDragStart` - prevents Stage from capturing drag start
  - `handleDragEnd` - prevents shape creation after drag
  - `handleTransformEnd` - prevents interference after resize

### 🐛 **Issue #5: Cmd/Ctrl+A Not Working**
**Root Cause**: Select All was only updating local `selectedShapeIds` state, not actually locking shapes in the store.

**Problem Flow**:
1. User presses Cmd/Ctrl+A
2. `selectedShapeIds` state updates ✅
3. But shapes don't get `isLocked`, `lockedBy` properties ❌
4. Visual selection appears but shapes aren't actually selected
5. Other operations don't recognize the selection

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated Cmd/Ctrl+A handler to actually lock all shapes for the user
- Uses `updateShapeOptimistic` to set `isLocked`, `lockedBy`, etc.
- Respects shapes already locked by other users (skips them)
- Batches Firebase lock acquisitions for performance
- Location: `ShapeLayer.tsx` → Select all useEffect

## Functionality Now Working

### ✅ Single Select
- Click any shape → selects it
- Releases previous selections
- Shows selection outline

### ✅ Multi-Select (Shift+Click)
- Shift+Click shape → adds to selection
- Shift+Click selected shape → removes from selection
- Maintains other selections

### ✅ Drag-to-Select (Marquee)
- Shift+MouseDown on empty area → starts selection rectangle
- Drag → shows blue marquee
- Release → selects all shapes inside rectangle

### ✅ Cmd/Ctrl+A
- Selects all shapes on canvas

### ✅ Shape Creation
- Click empty area → creates shape
- Uses current shape type and color from selector
- Doesn't interfere with selection

### ✅ Deselection
- Click empty area with shapes selected → deselects all
- Doesn't create shape when deselecting

### ✅ Drag Shapes
- Drag selected shape → moves it
- Maintains selection during drag
- Doesn't trigger shape creation on drop

### ✅ Resize/Transform
- Drag corner handles → resizes shape
- Shift during resize → locks aspect ratio
- Doesn't interfere with other operations

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/Canvas/ShapeLayer.tsx**
   - Added stopPropagation to: handleClick, handleDragStart, handleDragEnd, handleTransformEnd, handleLayerMouseDown
   - Added onTap support for mobile
   - **Fixed Cmd/Ctrl+A**: Now properly locks all shapes instead of just updating local state
   - Added batch lock acquisition for select all

2. **src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx**
   - Updated handleStageClick to accept both Stage and background-rect clicks
   - Proper target type checking

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Single shape selection works
- [x] Shift+Click multi-select works
- [x] Shift+Drag marquee selection works
- [x] Cmd/Ctrl+A select all works
- [x] Click empty to create shape works
- [x] Click empty to deselect works
- [x] Drag shapes works without side effects
- [x] Resize shapes works without side effects
- [x] Mobile tap support works

## Performance Impact

✅ **Minimal** - Event propagation stops are lightweight operations
✅ **No additional renders** - Only prevents unwanted handler executions
✅ **Improved UX** - Eliminates race conditions and unexpected behavior

## Future Considerations

1. **Mobile Touch Events**: onTap handlers added for mobile support
2. **Event Debugging**: Can add console.log to track event flow if needed
3. **Konva Updates**: Monitor Konva.js for event handling changes

---

**Summary**: All event propagation conflicts resolved. Multi-select, drag-to-select, shape creation, and all interactive features now work correctly without interference.
