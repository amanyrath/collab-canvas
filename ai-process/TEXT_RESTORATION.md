# Text Implementation Restoration

## Issue
After adding width/height parameters to `createShape`, text implementation was still using the old two-step process (create, then update), which wasn't working properly.

## Solution
Added `text` as a parameter to `createShape`, just like width/height, so text is included in the initial shape creation.

## Changes Made

### 1. `src/utils/shapeUtils.ts`
```typescript
// Added text parameter with default
export const createShape = async (
  x: number, 
  y: number, 
  type: 'rectangle' | 'circle',
  color: string,
  createdBy: string,
  displayName: string,
  width: number = 100,
  height: number = 100,
  text: string = ''  // ← Added this
): Promise<string>
```

### 2. `src/agent/actionExecutor.ts`
```typescript
// Pass text directly to createShape
const text = action.text || '';

const shapeId = await createShape(
  action.x, action.y, action.shape, fill,
  userContext.userId, userContext.displayName,
  width, height, text  // ← Pass text here
);
```

## How It Works Now

**Single Firebase Write:**
```typescript
createShape(x, y, 'rectangle', '#3b82f6', userId, name, 300, 50, 'Login')
// Creates shape with text in one operation ✅
```

**Before (Two Writes):**
```typescript
createShape(x, y, 'rectangle', '#3b82f6', userId, name) // text: ''
updateShape(shapeId, { text: 'Login' }) // Add text after
// Less reliable, race conditions ❌
```

## Test Commands

```bash
"Create a button that says Login"
"Create a rectangle with text Submit"
"Create a login form"
```

## Status
✅ **Text implementation fully restored**
✅ **More reliable** (single Firebase write)
✅ **Backward compatible** (other components unaffected)
