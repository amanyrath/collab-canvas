# Performance Optimizations for 500+ Shapes

## Changes Made

### 1. Batch Lock Operations (`lockUtils.ts`)
- **Before**: 500 individual Firebase transactions for select all
- **After**: Single batch write operation
- **Performance Gain**: ~5-10x faster for select all

### 2. Batch Store Updates (`canvasStore.ts`)
- **Before**: 500 individual state updates = 500 React re-renders
- **After**: 1 batch update = 1 React re-render
- **Performance Gain**: ~100-500x fewer re-renders

### 3. Optimized Shape Memoization (`ShapeLayer.tsx`)
- **Before**: Shapes re-render on any state change
- **After**: Shapes only re-render when their visual properties change
- **Performance Gain**: Significantly fewer shape re-renders

### 4. Optimized Transformer Updates (`ShapeLayer.tsx`)
- **Before**: Transformer updates on every shape change
- **After**: Transformer only updates on selection changes or shape type changes
- **Performance Gain**: Fewer expensive Konva operations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Pitfalls

### 1. **Race Conditions with Batch Operations**

**Issue**: Batch writes are NOT atomic across multiple documents like transactions are.

**Scenario**: 
- User A starts selecting all 500 shapes
- User B locks a shape while User A's batch is being processed
- User A's batch might overwrite User B's lock

**Current Mitigation**:
- We read all shapes first to check lock status
- Only lock shapes that are unlocked or already locked by the user
- However, between read and write, another user could acquire a lock

**Better Solution** (if needed):
```typescript
// Option 1: Accept the race condition (Figma does this)
// - Last write wins
// - Rare enough to not be a major issue

// Option 2: Add optimistic locking with version numbers
// - Add a `version` field to each shape
// - Increment on every lock/unlock
// - Retry batch if versions don't match

// Option 3: Hybrid approach for large selections
// - Use batch writes for 100+ shapes (accept race condition)
// - Use transactions for < 100 shapes (strict consistency)
```

### 2. **Firestore Query Limitations**

**Issue**: Firestore `where(documentId(), 'in', [...])` has a limit of 10 items (not 30 as I originally thought).

**Current Solution**: 
- Chunk queries into groups of 10
- Process chunks sequentially

**Potential Problem**:
- With 500 shapes, we need 50 queries to read all shapes
- This could be slow on poor network connections

**Better Solution** (if needed):
```typescript
// Option 1: Skip verification reads, directly lock all
// - Faster but less safe
// - Let Firestore sync handle conflicts

// Option 2: Parallel chunk processing
const chunkPromises = chunks.map(chunk => getDocs(query(...)))
const results = await Promise.all(chunkPromises)
// Much faster but more concurrent reads
```

### 3. **Firestore Batch Size Limit**

**Issue**: Firestore batch writes are limited to 500 operations.

**Current State**: ‚úÖ **NOT AN ISSUE** - We're within the limit

**Future Consideration**: If you ever need to select/update > 500 shapes:
```typescript
// Split into multiple batches
const BATCH_LIMIT = 500
for (let i = 0; i < validShapeIds.length; i += BATCH_LIMIT) {
  const batchChunk = validShapeIds.slice(i, i + BATCH_LIMIT)
  const batch = writeBatch(db)
  // ... add operations
  await batch.commit()
}
```

### 4. **Memory Usage with Large Selections**

**Issue**: Creating large arrays for batch operations uses memory.

**Current Impact**:
- 500 shapes √ó ~100 bytes per update object = ~50KB
- **NOT A PROBLEM** for modern browsers

**Watch For**:
- If you scale to 5,000+ shapes, consider pagination/virtualization

### 5. **React.memo Custom Comparison**

**Issue**: Custom comparison function must be accurate or you'll get stale renders.

**Current Risk**: 
```typescript
// If we forget to check a property that affects rendering:
prev.someNewProperty === next.someNewProperty // MISSING!
// Shapes won't re-render when they should
```

**Mitigation**:
- Keep `areShapePropsEqual` function updated
- If you add new visual properties to `Shape` type, update the comparison

### 6. **Optimistic Updates vs Firestore Sync**

**Issue**: Optimistic updates can be overwritten by slower Firestore syncs.

**Current Protection**: 
- 2-second timeout on optimistic updates
- Firestore updates ignored if optimistic update is recent

**Potential Problem**:
- If Firestore takes > 2 seconds to sync (poor connection)
- User's changes might get overwritten by stale data

**Monitor For**:
- Users on slow connections reporting "shapes jumping back"
- Increase `OPTIMISTIC_TIMEOUT` if needed

### 7. **Transformer Performance with 500 Shapes Selected**

**Issue**: Even optimized, selecting 500 shapes still attaches transformer to 500 nodes.

**Current State**: 
- Transformer only updates on selection change (not every render)
- Should be manageable but might still lag

**If Performance Issues Arise**:
```typescript
// Option 1: Disable transformer for large selections
if (selectedShapeIds.length > 100) {
  // Don't show resize handles
  transformer.nodes([])
} else {
  transformer.nodes(selectedNodes)
}

// Option 2: Show bounding box only
// Calculate collective bounds and show single resize box
```

### 8. **Network Failure Handling**

**Issue**: Batch operations can partially fail.

**Current Handling**: 
- We catch errors and log them
- Optimistic updates stay even if Firebase fails
- No rollback mechanism

**Consider Adding**:
```typescript
try {
  await batch.commit()
} catch (error) {
  // Rollback optimistic updates
  const rollbackUpdates = validShapeIds.map(id => ({
    shapeId: id,
    updates: { isLocked: false, lockedBy: null, ... }
  }))
  batchUpdateShapesOptimistic(rollbackUpdates)
  throw error
}
```

## üìä Testing Recommendations

### Performance Testing:
1. **Test with exactly 500 shapes**
   - Create 500 shapes
   - Time Cmd+A (should be < 500ms)
   - Time drag-to-select all 500 (should be < 1s)

2. **Test on slow connection**
   - Use Chrome DevTools Network throttling
   - Set to "Slow 3G"
   - Verify optimistic updates work smoothly

3. **Test concurrent edits**
   - Two users in different tabs
   - User A selects all
   - User B locks individual shapes during User A's selection
   - Verify no crashes, reasonable conflict resolution

4. **Test shape type changes with selection**
   - Select 100 shapes
   - Change all from rectangles to circles
   - Verify transformer updates correctly

### Memory Testing:
1. Open Chrome DevTools > Memory
2. Take heap snapshot before selecting all
3. Select all 500 shapes
4. Take heap snapshot after
5. Look for memory leaks (references not being cleaned up)

## üîç Monitoring in Production

Add these console logs to track performance:

```typescript
// In ShapeLayer.tsx - Select All
console.time('selectAll')
batchUpdateShapesOptimistic(batchUpdates)
console.timeEnd('selectAll') // Should be < 50ms

// In lockUtils.ts - Batch Lock
console.time('batchLockFirebase')
await batch.commit()
console.timeEnd('batchLockFirebase') // Should be < 500ms
```

## ‚úÖ What's Safe

1. **Batch store updates** - Very safe, just batching React updates
2. **React.memo optimization** - Safe as long as comparison function is complete
3. **Transformer optimization** - Safe, just fewer updates
4. **Chunk size of 10** - Safe, well within Firestore limits

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What to Watch

1. **Batch lock operations** - Potential for race conditions in multiplayer
2. **Network errors** - No rollback currently
3. **Large selections** - Could still lag with 500+ shapes selected

## üöÄ Future Optimizations (if needed)

1. **Canvas Virtualization** - Only render visible shapes
2. **WebRTC for Cursor Updates** - Peer-to-peer cursor sharing
3. **IndexedDB Caching** - Cache shape data locally
4. **Web Workers** - Offload heavy computations
5. **Lazy Transformer** - Don't show resize handles until user hovers over selection
